# Configuration file for different memories -- values aligned to vendor datasheets and JEDEC specs
# Notes:
# - latencies are given as typical "average/random access" estimates in nanoseconds (ns).
#   They reflect realistic access time including common command timings (tRCD + CAS + tRP) as seen in datasheets.
# - per_controller_bandwidth is per 64-bit channel (GB/s): MT/s * 64 / 8.
# - burst_size is expressed in number of beats (BL). With a 64-bit data path, 1 beat = 8 bytes.
# - chips_per_dimm is a typical/common value (varies by density, rank and vendor).
